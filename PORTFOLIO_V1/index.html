			<br>Who am I?<br>
			<br>
			Hi! My name is Josias Ribi. I was born and a still live in Switzerland. Currently, I’m 17 years old and in an apprenticeship as a media technologist. The company I’m working at is called “SBW Neue Medien” and located in Romanshorn (Switzerland).<br>
			<br>
			I have two main passions: Art and computers. I’ve managed to combine them in my job. Web design is the perfect example for that. As a media technologist, you will be occupied with all sorts of tasks. One of them is web design. Therefor you need skills in script languages (e.g. html) as well a mind for design and the look of your website. And it’s not just that. There will be administrative tasks, creators’ tasks and all kinds of things. That’s one reason why I love this job. Its diversity.
			In my opinion, one part of art is also music. For me, it’s the piano. I’ve played it already for about 5 years and I sure won’t stop. Even though I’ve stopped taking piano lessons, it’s still one of my passions. I also listen to a lot of different genres of music. The only thing I demand of music, is that has some quality in its own way. Whether the artist has given all his thoughts to the lyrics or the melody itself, I don’t care, if it isn’t some poorly made music.<br>
			<br>
			Well, that’s me. I hope you were able to get to know me!

			<p>
				The caddy project was, our first project to start out with the apprenticeship. We were asked to create an image representing us and our character. These images were necessary for labeling our personal lockers («Spinds»). I chose to create a digital self portrait painting using photoshop and my graphic tablet.

			<p>
				Our first «ZLO», creating a flyer. We were given all the design instructions, i.e. which colors to use. The challenge was to create an appealing flyer from ground up using only the allowed design elements. Mine turned out with a modern simplistic look.

				Our second «ZLO» was inventing a completely new product delivered as an animal food. Our instructions were creating a flyer, business card, package and of course the logo. To conclude we had to perform a presentation playing the role of someone trying to sell his product on the market.

				The third «ZLO» of the apprenticeship was to create a radio play. But it was not just about recording and editing the audio, we also needed to create the script, inventing the scenario and character, etc. It was really fun to do and my first time as a narrator.
