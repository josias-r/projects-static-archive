      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>
        I can’t be dead. It doesn’t make any sense. And I still feel alive. The creatures are coming closer. First, I thought the voice was coming from the creature, but now that there are three, it seems more like they are being controlled by that voice. The weak wooden walls won’t hold a chance against the creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m tighten my bow. I take a deep breath and then I aim for the creature in the centre which is the closest one. My Hands are still glowing, and I feel how the energy flows into the arrow. I release the string, and the arrow hisses through the air, leaving a trail of light behind. The arrow hits the eye and the creatures start screaming. The cry gets louder and louder, almost tearing my eardrums apart. I need to cover my ears. The other creatures twist their head around and start moving into my direction. It seems like they are floating, with the roots attached to the ground, paving the way through the dirt with an enormous speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The glowing arrow that I hit starts to spread its energy in the dead body of the creature and the head explodes in a bright light.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>
        This can’t be a dream. I try to tighten my bow again, but the energy coming from my hand is gone now. The arrow would probably shatter on the head again without that energy. My best chance now is to hide myself. I don't think I can fight another of those creatures without the mysterious energy. They have reached the wooden walls which allows me to flee around the corner into the butcher’s home. It’s just now that I realize that everything has turned grey again. There’s no colour in any of materials and textiles in the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hear the creatures utter some weird words in a language that I’ve never heard, followed by an explosion. Lurking through the small window in the bedroom, I see that they have broken down the wall. I wan not expecting the wall to hold up, but they broke it that fast? My heart starts pounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel tired. The energy must be coming from my body, I conclude. What happened to my body? I can see the bones right beneath my skin.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>
        What is happening? I can’t get up because my limbs are petrified. I can hear the creatures searching for me right where I stood when I shot the arrow. And there it is again. The disgusting smell, that reminds me of a rotting corps. They are so close that I can hear them talk. I can’t understand a single word, but the language still seems so familiar to me, even though I’ve never heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly something loud explodes right next to my head. Shocked and paralyzed I try to grasp what happened. I can see a black root that has pierced the wall next to my ear. This is what is attached to the creatures to the ground. They found me! One of the creatures is prowling through the doorframe. It’s almost breaks the whole wall down, because it can’t fit through with its enormous size. It hasn’t spotted me yet, hiding behind the piece of furniture.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I do? I’m going to die if I don’t make a move! My head is still spinning and I’m desperately thinking of a way out, when something starts pulling my chest. Not physically. It feels weird, as if I’m floating in water, getting carried away from a strong stream in the water.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>
        My eyes are almost closed from my fatigue. I can see the creature fading away and the light brightening through the door. The colour slowly returns into the material and textiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Photios!”, the butchers head appears around the corner. “How did you get in here?”, he asks me confused and startled. “I, I ran to get cover”, I whisper just before my eyes close. I can hear him running up to me and picking me up. He’s carrying me over to the bed and gently laying me down. I want to ask him where my mum and my brother are but I’m to weak to say anything. Not much later I black out. Again.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>
        Warm sunlight glimpsing through the window wakes me up. I need to blink a couple of times before I can barely see my surroundings. I’m still in the bedroom of the butcher. My brother is sleeping right next to me on the floor. I try to wake him up but there is no sound coming from my lips. Creaking sounds are coming from the corridor and a silhouette of a woman walks up to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh hey, you’re awake”, says the gentile voice of the butcher’s wife to me. I nod. She bends down to me, holding a cup of water to my lips: “Drink, Photios. You have been asleep for almost two weeks now.” Laborious I point my finger to my brother. “He is so sweet!”, the wife says, “You brother has slept next to you every day to wait for you to wake up.” A genuine smile forms across my face until I remembered what even happened. The creatures, the lost world, have I lost my mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        I smile at the butcher’s wife thankfully for her support and she tells me I should get some rest and that I can talk to my brother tomorrow.
