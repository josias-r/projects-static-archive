      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>
        It has not been long since the encounter with the creature. It still haunts me at night even at day my family feels how nervous I’ve gotten. Every little crack or strange noise makes me jump.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t want to admit it, but I have the bad feeling something is still wrong. And it’s not just me. People have reported strange incidences from the forest. Just yesterday they have found a dead rabbit. Its corpse has been teared apart in half with the head missing. Something Is wrong and I’m afraid it might have something to do with my encounter.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>
        “Hurry up and go get your brother!”, my mother shouts,“ we have to be ready when the market opens, or we will lose all the good deals.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She is right. Since I haven’t brought home much hunting yield, we need to buy provision at the market to survive the winter. I haven’t told them about the monster yet, they still think I had bad luck at the hunt, better so, I don’t want them to panic nor them to think I might have gone crazy, I’m not sure about that myself either. Maybe I hallucinated, but everything felt so real.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come on little brother! Let’s go to the market, I’ll buy you some sweets if you hurry up!”
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>
        He is always so excited when we go to the market. For me it’s the opposite. I can’t understand why my brother likes the chaos so much, it’s probably a big adventure the way he sees it. For me it’s just too loud, way too loud. Everyone is screaming and fighting over the price. It's a scrap of comfort that there are less people that early.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come over here son!”, the old man from the butcher’s shop calls. “That’s exactly where I was heading”, I shout back with a smile, at least one pleasing thing about this market. The butcher always has some exciting stories ready. I wonder what he has to offer this time. Just when I set food into the direction of the butcher shop the villages warning horn tears apart the early morning.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>
        Silence. Nobody dares to say anything for a second. Then a man from the look-out bursts in. “Marauders! Marauders! Hide everything you own and care about, or they will take it!”, he screams through the whole markets. In a fraction of a second everyone was panicking. After enjoying the silence for a second, I took my brother by his hand, who was chewing the sweats confused about what was going on. “Let’s go and get our mother”, I tell him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much later something strange happened. Whilst packing everything valuable to go and hide it, I saw something odd. Clouds showed up in the north, were the marauders seemed to come from. But those clouds weren’t normal, they were black. The sun has risen quite high already and the sky was clear. Except those strange clouds. I felt something cold crawl up my legs. “You see that mom? I’ll go and check it out”, I say pointing to the sky. “See what?”, she asks.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>
        I’m getting confused more and more. Shaking my head, I head north, ignoring what just happened. It’s not like you could oversee the pitch-black clouds in the sky. Arriving at the edge to overlook the scenery a lump in my throat forms. It’s the creature! Even worse, now there are three of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hurry back as fast as I can to get my bow. There it was again the bright light glowing on my palm. It’s not as bright as it was last time though, rather a warm orange slightly yellow glow. Without thinking too much about It I grab my bow and arrow and turn around. There it was again. This putrid hiss saying my name. “Photios!”, appears in my head.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>
        “What are you?”, I answer in my head. Silence. But then. “Do you know what you are”, the voice asks emphasizing the word ’you’, as it was something special. “My name is Photios, but you have figured that out already!”, I return. The creature only answered with a hideous laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever it is, I knew it wasn’t here with friendly intentions. We had to fight it off. That’s when I realized there was no “we”. I was alone. Where has everyone gone? My family, the citizens from the village, no one was around. It’s like I was captured in a parallel world just without a living thing except me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or was I dead?
