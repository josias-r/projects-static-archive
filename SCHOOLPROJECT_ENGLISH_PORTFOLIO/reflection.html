        Throughout my time in English lessons, I’ve not learned a lot in school. I’ve never been a fan of the school system, especially if it comes to learning languages. Regardless, there has been some things (mostly grammar) that I was able to improve in my time in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I learn a language is way more practical. With practical, I’m not thinking about a “speaking exercise”, rather applying the language in an every day task. Coding for instance rellies a lot on English. Therefor I’m basically always in an English mindset when working on a project. The other thing I’m practicing since a couple years, is watching movies in their original language. I’ve come to like it that way a lot more then watching a movie translated to German, simply because you start to hear (and see the lips sync) the synchronised “fake” audio track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since most movies I watch are originally filmed in English, it has helped me a lot regarding my “listening” and “understanding” skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        English in general is a language I’ve come to appreciate. I think compared to German it has a way larger spectrum of words and phrases you can use to express emotions and thoughts. That’s way I’ve started to change everything around me to the English. I work in English, I’ve set-up my devices in English, watch YouTube in English and sometimes even find myself thinking in English.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, I think my English skills won’t really improve too much in the future nor in school. The only way that’s going to change is when there is a practical need for me to improve myself. There’s no need for me at this point to improve my “understanding” skills, I’m not that strong at speaking thought. If I’m not going to travel or live in an English-speaking country, that will probably not change too much in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        My opinion for learning strategies is, like I mentioned, still that only practical use really helps. I will learn a couple of grammar rules in school, but if there’s no other need that school for me to use that knowledge, I’m going to forget about it for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t think the English lessons really need a change, it’s just not my way of learning a language.
