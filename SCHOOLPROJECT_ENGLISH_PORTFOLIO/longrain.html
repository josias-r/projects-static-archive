      <h2>alternative ending</h2>
      <p>
        He tried to run but couldn’t move. His limbs were petrified. It almost ironic that it ends this way, the lieutenant thinks to himself. But then he sees the bright light glowing from the dome. He puts his numb hand up against the light. Warm energy flows through his body. And his hope awakes once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        One foot after another he starts to fights his way forward. The time went fast as he struggled to move forward and he found himself at a large gate. The sun dome. The rain seems to have disappeared up to this point but the splashing sound is still stuck in his head. His arms aren’t powerful enough to swing open the gate but a strange lever catches his eyes. A light pull was enough to tilt the lever as it hammers down and locks into place.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a long creek the gates swing open and a bright light flashes upfront the lieutenant’s eyes. Hi begins to question his decision for the journey as he realizes the emptiness welcoming him. Nothing. Not a single object in the room, no windows no doors just pure void. Strange coloured stone slabs lay down on the ground. He steps on one of them and an echoing clack sound through the hall. A password it might be! With his lack of imagination, he presses down all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole dome starts to rumble as the roof starts to crumble. Big chunks of stone start to loosen themselves although the dome seemed so robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regrets flash through his mind as a rock crushes his head. What’s a secret may never be resolved.
