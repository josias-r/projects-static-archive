      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Josias Ribi. I was born and a still live in Switzerland. Currently, I’m 18 years old and in an apprenticeship as a media technologist. The company I’m working at is called “SBW Neue Medien” and located in Romanshorn (Switzerland).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have two main passions: Art and computers. I’ve managed to combine them in my job. Web design is the perfect example for that. As a media technologist, you will be occupied with all sorts of tasks. One of them is web design. Therefor you need skills in script languages (e.g. html) as well a mind for design and the look of your website. And it’s not just that. There will be administrative tasks, creators’ tasks and all kinds of things. That’s one reason why I love this job. Its diversity.<br>
        In my opinion, one part of art is also music. For me, it’s the piano. I’ve played it already for about 5 years and I sure won’t stop. Even though I’ve stopped taking piano lessons, it’s still one of my passions. I also listen to a lot of different genres of music. The only thing I demand of music, is that has some quality in its own way. Whether the artist has given all his thoughts to the lyrics or the melody itself, I don’t care, if it isn’t some poorly made music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that’s me. I hope you were able to get to know me!
      </p>
