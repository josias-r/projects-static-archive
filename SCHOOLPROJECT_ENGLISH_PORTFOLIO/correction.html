        The use of VR is not only available for students on campus it’s also available for those who are accessing Arizona State’s learning modules online. They are the first University which’s providing worldwide access to the first fully online molecular biology lab using virtual reality simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The online Students buy those headsets at the beginning of the semester and send it in the end back again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to embrace virtual reality comes about as part of a partnership with Google and VR company Labster. Arizona State has worked with both organizations for several years, although this marks the first time that VR has officially been used as a core component of the university’s classes.
      </p>

        Victoria Quintana was among the ASU students asked to test run the new VR headsets for ASU Online last summer. Quintana admits, “Compared to hands-on, it’s not the same, but it’s still more interesting to see it rather than to just read about it in a book.” But she also notes, “The visuals were really good, especially when we got to the electronic transfer chain, and I like that it had a sense of humor.”

        Especially in a biology course it must be very helpful to see those things, which you other ways only could learn out of a book. We think that with visual learning content you can keep things much better in mind than with regular methods like worksheets or reading material. It also must be very funny to for example be in a human cell and its scientifically proved that you learn things better when having fun while learning.
