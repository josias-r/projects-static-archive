      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>
        My ears are ringing. How did I end up here? What are those strange stones I’m sitting on? So many questions… I grab a branch with my right hand and pull myself up. Shimmering moonlight appears now from behind the grey clouds. It reveals the strange stones, which appears to be bones. Human bones. I step back, startled. My back pressing against the tree that seems to be growing in the middle of the pile of bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wake up gasping. Eyes wide opened and my chest burning. I had one of those dreams again, it’s getting worse. The bones are new. Someone knocks on my door. You can come in! My mother enters my room. “Are you okay sweetie?” she asked. I hate it when she calls me that. “I’m fine, just had a bad dream,” I answer. She seems worried. “Do you want come eat breakfast with us?” she asks. I tell her that I will be ready in a second.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>
        “Catch!” I throw my straw ball in a high arc over to my younger brother, who eagerly runs after it. Its strange to see him running like this after he just learned walking. At least it feels like that, time runs fast…
      </p>
      <p>
        “Photios!” My mother calls me vigorously. “You should be on the hunt right now,” she says. “Well, I will go tomorrow, I want to enjoy my time with my brother before I leave,” I answer. The fact that I can’t see my family for one month on the big hunt is hard on my shoulders. Most of the men in town already left. Winter is coming, we must be prepared for it. At least we have enough firewood for this year. Everyone is exited for this years hunting season except me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without my father, who deceased last year, I have all the responsibility. He suffered from a disease that has been affecting our town for a while now. We found him dead in his bed one day. Since then my mother does her best in supporting me in any way she can. Luckily my father knew that that day will come, that he is gone. He taught me a lot of things, which is why I am very independent already.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>
        There it is! The deer I’ve been tracking for hours stands right in front of me. “Just one accurate shot”, I tell myself and then intently tighten my bow. I align my shot, take a deep breath and let go. A silent hiss sounds through the forest. I hit it! Unfortunately, it seems that the deer survived. It turns around, frightened and stars running. “Bloody deer! It must be deadly wounded”, I say out of frustration. Annoyed by the animal, I continue following the tracks. The blood makes it way easier now.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s still running east, it can’t be far, I notice from the blood drips. Suddenly a grey fog appears in the forest. At that moment I realised how far I already travelled east. I should be turning back right now; strange things happen in this feared part of the forest. It can’t be that all the effort was for nothing, I must find my prey. Brown fur shines through the leaves. I press the thicket beside and look down on the dead body. I take out my hunting knife and start preparing the animal for transport.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>
        The thirst is burning in my throat. I take my water skin from my back to take a sip. The water drizzles down my throat into my body. I have been wandering in the fog for probably an hour now. It doesn’t seem to go away. An odd feeling runs through my body. I feel like something is pressing down on me. “I’m probably getting tired”, I think and walk on with difficulties to stay upright. I must rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fallen tree beside me seems welcoming to sit down. I put aside my bags and take a deep breath. Suddenly an ear shattering cry appears in the distance. “What was that?” It sounded like something was howling. But it seemed familiar to me. “My dreams! I’ve heard that sound in my dreams already”, I realise. “Am I dreaming?”  Frightened by eat I try to walk on. But I can’t. “What is going on?” I feel paralyzed. My eyes are closing slowly.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>
        My ears are ringing. I find myself in the dark. Something seems wrong. At that moment I begin to realise where I am. My palms are feeling the cold bones beneath me. I jump up quickly. “How is this possible, I was just dreaming.”, but this is real. A cruel smell spreads around me. It smells like rotten flesh. I notice how root-like growths are spreading from the Tree. They seem to twine around the surrounding. All the sudden, the same cry as I heard before howls through the night.  I draw my bow and arrow and prepare myself for the worst. It howls again, this time closer. I quickly run behind the next best cover I find. A creature jumps out of nowhere. It seems to be hovering, but no! The root-like things are keeping it to the ground. The creature is attached to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A foolish step backwards on to a stick gets the attention of that thing. It quickly turns its head around towards me. I release the taut string. The arrow whizzes through the air. I can see the arrow hitting the creatures head in slow motion, but the sharp arrowhead breaks on the hard surface. It rears up at the cry appears once more.
      </p>
      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>
        Warm blood is dripping from my nose. I feel a strong energy bundle up in me. I look down on my palms. They have started glowing very bright. The creature is quickly moving towards me. I extend my arms to it. My handy are seizing it and at that moment I hear a frightened whisper coming from the creature: “Photios!” I black out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chirping birds and bright sunlight wake me up. “The fog, it’s gone!” I look up the enormous tree right next to me. I take a close look at the tree and see a grotesque face in the bark. “The creature!” Still confused by what happened I pack my stuff. The rising sun tells me which direction is west, my home. “It might have just been one of my crazy dreams”, I tell myself, and head towards home.
      </p>
      <p>
        My little brother and my mother greet me from the far. Joy fulfils me. Everything seems back to normal.
