        As a gamer myself, I’ve had my experience regarding Loot-Boxes myself. So how have I been affected by it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I’m definitely not the guy who spends a lot of money on games, Loot-Boxes specifically, I think I never spent any money on. So, for my part, I don’t think there should be a change in the system for now, but if there is an obvious problem with a games reward system like the oh-so popular controversial topic “Star Wars Battlefront” the community is going to interfere. Also, I think Loot-Boxes in general can’t be stamped as bad, since it’s just one way of the game industry to earn money. Whether you are required to buy levels or Loot-Boxes to proceed the game itself doesn’t make much of a difference. So, what can you do about it if you come across overprized and manipulating games? Well, basically the same thing you would do when walking across an overprized store, think if the reward is worth the cost and then decide if you are willing to pay the money. The only problem with games is, that there are kids who can’t decide that for themselves at that point, in that case though, the decision lies on their parents, since they must give their child permission to spent money at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as a quick summary, I think Loot-Boxes aren’t a problem if they aren’t abused just to squeeze as much money out of a game as possible, and the only effective way to go about it is self-awareness and parental control.
