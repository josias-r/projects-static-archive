      <h2>The Little Prince</h2>
      <h2>entry 1</h2>
      <p>
        The book is quite different to a usual book. It’s written similar to a child book but still has some very philosophical thoughts behind the words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The narrator includes himself as the pilot in the story who meets the little prince after a plane crash in the middle of the desert. They talk about different things, mostly problems and struggles comparing adults to children, where the little prince of course represents children.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I’ve mentioned does the book have some deeper meanings, but it also leaves the reader open for his own interpretation.
      </p>
      <h2>entry 2</h2>
      <p>
        Before the little prince met the pilot, he had his journey through the galaxy, where he met different people, for instance a geographer, a drunkard and so on. The reason he didn’t stay on his asteroid (Asterroid B-612) was because there he grew a rose which started to complain a lot. He tried to escape those complains and demands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, all the grown-ups the prince meets are stuck with one stupid problem that the small prince can’t understand. The book made me realize that the system we have can be very trivial in some cases. Children who don’t fall under such obligations are following their heart and emotions which seems more important if you think about it.
      </p>
      <h2>entry 3</h2>
      <p>
        The way the little prince ended up on earth was because after meeting all those weird people he started missing his rose. A geographer, the last person he met before arriving on earth, told him that he should check out earth where roses grow. He also told him that flowers in general are ephermal which means they don’t last forever and because of that they aren’t included in the geographer’s work. That’s why the prince started missing his rose in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        He continued his journey to earth.
      </p>
      <h2>entry 4</h2>
      <p>
        Something that was stuck in my head after reading the book, was where the little prince asks the pilot to draw him a sheep. The pilot tries and tries but the prince is never happy. The he comes up with an idea. He draws a box with breathing holes in it and tells the prince that the sheep he was asking for is hidden inside the box. That satisfied the prince’s needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this passage show how we lose our creativity when we get older as we start to implement us into the every-day system. Also, we should maybe think more about what we have and be happy with that instead of thinking of specific things we want in life.
      </p>
      <h2>entry 5</h2>
      <p>
        Another important part in the book is, where a fox shows the little prince a flower bed with lots of roses. The little prince realizes that his rose wasn’t unique and is upset at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point in his journey though, he found out that it’s not really about the physics of a specific object or person that we like, it’s the mental connection and emotions that made him miss his rose.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point the little prince fights his way bake home.
